## REMARK:
#### The data used for this project exceeds the amount allowed by the COM-480 GitHub group. As such, we have uploaded our data separately to https://github.com/Tsathogguaa/project-2024-SteamViz-Data which is a public repository of one of our members, Derin Arda Alpay. This action has been made after inquiring and validating through the Ed Forum with a TA, under post #43 named "Git LFS". If there is any trouble accessing the data or the repository as a whole, please send a direct email to derin.alpay@epfl.ch.

#### Also, for M2 and onwards, the website can be found on: https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/project-2024-SteamViz/

## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Please refer to the report(SteamViz_M1.pdf file) in the repo.

### Problematic

> Please refer to the report(SteamViz_M1.pdf file) in the repo.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Please refer to the EDA.ipynb notebook in the repo.
> #### Remark: We use an interactive plotting package, meaning if you preview the notebook on Github it won't show the figures. However, if you open the notebook on your own end, it works fine. As a precaution, you may also find the plots in the "plots" folder of our repo as pdf files, along with a plot_order.txt file telling in which order the plots appear in EDA.ipynb if needed.

## Milestone 2 (26th April, 5pm)

Our skeleton website can be found on: https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/project-2024-SteamViz/
Our report can be found on our repo, root, as "SteamViz_M2.pdf".

**10% of the final grade**


## Milestone 3 (31st May, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**

No need to do any setup. You can simply go to the link mentioned above to visit our website.

Reproducibility-wise, get the data, put it under the name "games.csv" inside data/, then you can run the notebooks and put the resulting csv files from data/ into docs/ and it should work. You may need several python packages, namely the ones used in M1 and M2, nothing new. Named, they are:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Process book and screencast can be found on the repo root, under the names SteamVizProcessBook and SteamVizScreencast.

Please contact derin.alpay@epfl.ch in case of a need for more clear instructions or any other questions.


## Late policy

- < 24h: 80% of the grade for the milestone
